= Thanks

An early version of this module required Inline::Python (by
https://metacpan.org/author/NINE and others)
and HspellPy ( https://pypi.org/project/HspellPy/ ) from PyPI
(by https://github.com/eranroz/ ), so thanks to them.
The dependency on these packages was removed in version 0.2.0.

Thanks to the authors of hspell and libhspell:
http://nadav.harel.org.il/[Nadav Harâ€™EL], http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~danken/[Dan Kenigsberg]
and possibly others.
